## Used software

- git
- vs-code
- Platform IO
- Arduino
- Github (Regular and vs-code extension)


## Recomended software

- C/C++ extension for VSCode
- Tabnine because guessing AI's are cool
- Preferably connect VSCode to Github so you can se changes in real time


## Systems

These are the systems that are currently planned:


### Telemetry
- Datastorage
    - All the data points
        - FLASH
        - SD card
- Altimeter
    - Barometer and integrals of acceleration
- Accelerometer
    - Rotation and acceleration
- GPS
    - Only active if in static or late descent stage


### Recovery

- Parachute
- State recognition ( Logged to pins )
    - Accelerating ascent
    - Ascent
    - Apogee dedicated pin
    - Descent
    - Slow descent
    - Static
- Finding the rocket
